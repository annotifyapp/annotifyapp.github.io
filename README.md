# Collaborative workflow mgmt for distributed, reproducible, extensible reliability engineering data analyses with annotated discussion and notifications for peer review.

In general, we see this implementation as being about using patterns and re-using as much code as possible from the Pythonic data science ecosystem, eg [Conda package mgmt](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), the [Jupyter architecture](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/architecture/content-architecture.html) and the [standard .ipynb JSON notebook schema](https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat), [SnakeMake workflow mgmt system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), as well as others, like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Amazon EMR JupyterHub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ReleaseGuide/emr-jupyterhub.html) or others which use a similar, ***nearly*** standard architecture.

We believe that this distributed, but version-controlled workflow should work well for those who are already famililar with [advanced Git[Lab] workflows](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html) of including affiliated methods, processes, issues, CI/CD pipelines and a wide variety of tools used in MLops. Data engineering for reliability engineering and warranty tracking in systems [which often involve products from different, possibly competing companies and entities] is perhaps not really so much feature-based as with software as much as the forks in the reliability analyses might be annotation-based or driven by cross-referenced or other documented concerns which arise during peer-review of the analyses of issues and opportunities for improvement.  

# Annotify.App will be an illustrative example of the Annotify.ORG open source workflow mgmt system.

Annotify.APP will be primarily intended to illustrate, in one specific example, how the ANNOTIFY.ORG open source material might be implemented. The goal, at least at first, of ANNOTIFY.APP will be exclusively for illustration ... it is possible that this example could also evolve into a separate product ... but as all open source advocates well know **projects are not products** ... illustrative examples of projects are not immediately intended to be products.
